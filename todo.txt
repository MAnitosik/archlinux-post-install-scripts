- 1 file script for everything in this repository
- a detailed file which explains the architecture of this project
- fix grammar everywhere in this repo
- use v2raya instead of throne (+ configure v2raya)
- more laptop specific optimisations (not sure tho)
- maybe change opencoder to smth else like qwen-coder (thinking about it because opencoder is temporally free as far as I get it)
