- 1 file script for everything in this repository
- a detailed file which explains the architecture of this project (not related to architecture.md, even more detailed)
- less cachyos, more archwiki optimisations/configs
- make sure that every needed programm installed and enabled (e.g. zram-generator for zram-generator.conf tho it should be installed by default already)
- chore: read more arch wiki for optional deps for programms I install, also check if config files are in correct locations so it works
- UPower in scripts (currently not used due to need to read more wiki)
