- 1 file script for everything in this repository
- a detailed file which explains the architecture of this project
- update comments (they suck and my grammar sucks, lol), fix grammar overall everywhere (probably gonna just use AI for such minor issues since I am still not fluent in english)
- gamescope guide/script (gaming overall)
- use v2raya instead of throne
