- 1 file script for everything in this repository
- a detailed file which explains the architecture of this project (not related to architecture.md, even more detailed, should explain the point of everything in this project)
- less cachyos, more archwiki optimisations/configs
- cpupower config + systemd unit
- analyzing boot times and ways to minimize them
- hibernation issues on laptops (related to swap somehow, probably gonna just change it to sleep in upower config)
